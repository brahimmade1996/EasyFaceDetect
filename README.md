# Easy Face Detection

## Introduction
This repository uses an implementation of MTCNN in Tensorflow for Python 3.4+. The implementation is based off [FaceNet's implementation of MTCNN](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/tree/master/src/align) which is based on the paper Zhang, K et al. (2016) <sup>[1](#references)</sup>

All procedures done are to optimise performance of the MTCNN implementation on a private dataset.
I decided to test out the following methods to improve detection results.
- Gamma Correction
- Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation (CLAHE)
- Tan and Triggs Illumination Normalisation <sup> [2](#references)</sup>
- Image Resizing

Through trial and testing (which can be seen in the Google Colab Notebook), the following decisions were taken:
- Removal of Tan and Triggs Illumination Normalisation from the Face Detection Pipeline since it showed decreased performance on the given dataset
- The best value of gamma to improve dynamic range turns out to be **1.6**

>**Note:** Tan and Triggs Illumination Normalisation will come in handy while extracting features from cropped faces to do Face Recognition, therefore the code is preserved in the repository.

## Usage
- Clone this repository. We will call this directory as *`$DETECTION_ROOT`*
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kaaanishk/EasyFaceDetect
```
- Move into the directory
```
$ cd DETECTION_ROOT
```
> **Note:** Change  *`$DETECTION_ROOT`* to the folder name of the cloned repository.
- Run `detect.py` with required arguments.
```
$ python3 detect.py --url [link to photo]
```
- The cropped faces would be saved in the `$DETECTION_ROOT/out/`
> **Note:** Change the `path=/home/kanishk/fd/out/` variable in `detect.py` to change the output folder.

| Optional Finetune Variables      | Default   | Description                                               |
|:---------------------------------|----------:|:----------------------------------------------------------|
|--resize_width                    | 600       | Change size of the resized image for preprocessing. The height of the resized image is calculated while preserving the ratio according to the specified width |
| --gamma                          | 1.6       | Change the gamma correction value for image preprocessing.|
>**Note:** It is recommended to keep the default values for the optional arguments.

## Progress
- [x] Implement and fine-tune basic image pre-processing techniques
- [x] Implement Tan and Triggs Illumination Normalisation according to Paper
- [x] Implement MTCNN Face Detection
- [x] Crop Faces to `112x112` to pass onto Face Recognition Module
